**They put me in the oven to bake.\
Me, a deprived and miserable cake.\
Feeling the heat, I started to bubble.\
Watching the others, I knew I was in trouble.\
\
They opened the door and I started my life.\
Frosting me with a silver knife,\
Decorating me with candy jewels.\
The rest of my batch looked like fools.\
\
Lifting me up, she took off my wrapper.\
Feeling the breeze, I wanted to slap her.\
Opening her mouth with shiny teeth inside,\
This was the day this cupcake died.**
